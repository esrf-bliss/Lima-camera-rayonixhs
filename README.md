# LImA Andor SDK3 Camera Plugin

This is the LImA plugin for Rayonix HS detectors.

# Install

There is no conda packages for this detector family. One should compile from the main project source code. Refer to the Lima documentation below.

Lima ( **L** ibrary for **Im** age **A** cquisition) is a project for the unified control of 2D detectors. The aim is to clearly separate hardware specific code from common software configuration and features, like setting standard acquisition parameters (exposure time, external trigger), file saving and image processing.

Lima is a C++ library which can be used with many different cameras. The library also comes with a [Python](http://python.org) binding and provides a [PyTango](http://pytango.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) device server for remote control.
